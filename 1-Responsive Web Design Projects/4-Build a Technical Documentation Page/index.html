      <p>'If statements' revolve around whether or not something equates to true. Here we use the if keyword, followed
        by my_variable, which in this case is a bool, with the value of True. The boolean is called the condition and is
        what makes up an if statement. After the if statement we have a print() function that we use to print out the
        value of my_variable.</p>
      <p>Four blank spaces indent this code. The indented code is called a code block. We indent this part of the code
        to inform Python that we don’t always want to execute this code. Before we want to indent a piece of code, we
        need to use the colon delimiter (:).</p>
      <code>(5 – 3 * 1 + 1) * (6 * 1 – 5) = 3 </code>
      <p>The colon informs Python that the next line of code will be part of a code block. Because our variable contains
        a value of True, our condition will evaluate to true. Anything contained within the if statement will be
        executed, meaning that the variable will be printed. Try changing the value of my_variable to False and see what
        happens!</p>

      <p>Any of these are acceptable. However, Python comes with it’s standard for writing readable code called PEP8
        (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).</p>
      <code>first_number = 10</code><br />
      <code>second_number = 5</code>
      <p>This standard only acts as guidelines for how code should be written to make all code as readable to all Python
        developers.</p>
      <p>PEP8 recommends using lowercase variable names and any variable names that contain spaces should use
        underscores as spaces.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Types_Of_Numbers">
      <header>Types Of Numbers</header>
      <p>In Python, there are two different types of numbers that we work with on a regular basis. Up until now, we’ve
        mostly been looking at whole numbers. In mathematical terms, these numbers are usually integers. In computer
        programming, however, an integer is called an int for short. The other type of numbers that Python offers is a
        floating point number, or float for short. A float is a number that is followed by a decimal point. For example,
        a float might look like 12.74 whereas an int might be just12 or 13, depending on whether you choose to round up
        or not!</p>
      <p>The reason that we need to differentiate between the two different types of numbers is so that Python can
        inform the computer of how much memory will need to be allocated to store that value because ints require more
        memory than floats. Thankfully Python will mostly work within the confines of these two types of numbers; unlike
        other languages such as Java or C#, which have small ints, long ints, doubles and many more</p>
      <p>We don’t need to do this in Python. The reason for this is that Python is what we call a dynamically typed
        language. Therefore we don’t have to specify the type because Python will make that determination for us at
        runtime (while the program is running), meaning that we can focus on writing code instead of making sure we get
        all of our types correct! This is often referred to as duck-typing.
        The philosophy here is: If it quacks, treat it as duck, otherwise, handle it differently. For example, if we
        have a variable that contains a number that doesn’t have a decimal point, treat it as an int; otherwise, if it
        does have a decimal point, treat it as a float. A language that requires us to specify the type of variable that
        we wish to declare is called a statically typed language. Java and C# are examples of this, but we’re not going
        to cover those here.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Range">
      <header>Range</header>
      <p>Instead of just starting from 0, we can use additional arguments to achieve various sequence combinations. We
        know this by looking at the Python documentation for range() -
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range. Looking at the documentation is a great way of finding
        out more information about the functions that Python provides.</p>
      <code>print('Then Mike said "what is that?"')</code>
      <p>range() can take up to three arguments, which are:</p>
      <code>my_string = "HELLO WORLD"</code><br />
      <code>my_string_lower_case = my_string.lower()</code><br />
      <code>print(my_string_lower_case)</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Start - This is the first argument that range() accepts. It is an optional argument and will be given a
          default value of 0.
        </li>
        <li>Stop - This is the second argument. It is the number at which to stop our sequence. In order for range() to
          work, we need to provide a stop argument.</li>
        <li>Step - This is the last argument that range() takes. It is also an optional argument. If we don’t provide
          one, Python will default to 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the last example, we only supplied one argument. Given that the start and step arguments are optional, the
        argument that we provided was the stop argument. This indicates that we want a sequence comprised of 5 numbers.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="For_Loops">
      <header>For Loops</header>
      <p>For loops allow us to iterate over a predefined set of data. Unlike a while loop, which will run so long as
        some condition is true, for loops focus on iterating over collections of data and will perform a task for each
        item in a given collection. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of working with collections and for loops, we’ll
        take a look at the anatomy of a for loop and the range() function.</p>
      <code>
      for item in range(5):</code><br />
      <code>print(item)</code>
      <p>For loops allow us to iterate over a sequence of data</p>
      <p>The range function will generate a sequence of numbers.
        By passing through an argument of 5, we’re saying that we wish for that sequence to be comprised of 5 <numbers
          class=""></numbers>
      </p>
      <p>Most programming languages, including Python, are zero-based. Therefore they start counting at 0 instead of 1.
      </p>
      <p>When we use the range function to generate a sequence of 5 numbers, it will create a series ranging from 0-4.
        Those numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. We use the for loop to iterate each of the numbers in this sequence. </p>
      <p>The way in which we build up a for loop is by first using the for keyword.
        After the for keyword we have item. item is a variable name. This variable will act as a placeholder. </p>
      <p>After item, we have in. It just tells Python what sequence of data we wish to iterate over.
        For each iteration of the for loop, Python will get the next item from the series and store it in the item
        variable so we can use it inside the for loop.
        Then inside the for loop we simply print out each item of the sequence, starting at 0 and working up to 4.</p>
      <code>for key, value in all_users_dict.items():
      do stuff</code>

      <header>Modules</header>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow us to use more functions built into the Python language</li>
        <li>We don’t always need to reinvent the wheel, as Python comes with a plethora of modules that each contain a
          lot of functions that we can use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Python, we call a Python file a module.
        Python comes with a plethora of modules, but as a developer, we also create modules every time we create our
        files. We can even import functions, classes, and variables from other modules. One example of one of Python’s
        built-in modules is random
        An example of how we can import the randint function from the random module:</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <p><strong>def:</strong> This is the keyword that we use to tell Python that we are creating a function
        definition.
        print_message: This is the name that we’ve decided to give our function. Be sure to give your functions
        meaningful names so that when other people try to use your code, they’ll able to make sense of what the function
        does without having to read the code in the function.</p>
      <p>(): The parentheses denote the parameters that a function takes. In this example, we don’t have any parameters
        yet, but we’ll start adding some in soon.</p>
      <code>
    def print_message():<br />
    <code>print("Hello World")<br /></code>

      <code>print_message()    </code>
      </code>
